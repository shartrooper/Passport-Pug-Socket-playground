## Introduction to Advanced Node and Express Challenges

Continue on the path of exploring [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) functionality including working with middleware packages in our Express Application.

Authentication is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process

The most common and easiest way to use authentication middleware for Node.js is [PassportJS](https://passportjs.org/). It is easy to learn, light-weight, and extremely flexible allowing for many strategies, which we will talk about in later challenges. We will also explore template engines, specifically [PugJS](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), and web sockets, [Socket.io](https://socket.io/). Web sockets allow for real time communication between all your clients and your server. Working on these challenges will involve writing your code on Repl.it using our starter project. After completing each challenge you can copy your public Repl.it url (the homepage of your Repl.it app) into the challenge screen to test it! Optionally, you may choose to write your project on another platform but it must be publicly visible for our testing.
